### Pizza Sales Report
This is a self-motivated PowerBI project.

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT

The customer needs to analyze key indicators of pizza sales data to gain insights into their business. 
Specifically, the customer wants to calculate the following metrics:

1. Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.

2. Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.

3. Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of all pizzas sold.

4. Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.

5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas 
sold by the total number of orders.


#### CHARTS

The customer would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. 
Identified the following for creating charts:

1. Daily Trend for Total Orders:
Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. 
This chart will help us identify any patterns or in-order volumes on a daily basis.

2. Monthly Trend for Total Orders:
Create a line chart that illustrates the monthly trend of total orders throughout the day. 
This chart will allow us to identify peak months or periods of high order activity.

3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:
Create a pie chart that shows the of sales across diff√®rent pizza categories. 
This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizzas and their overall sales.

#### DATASOURCE 

Here I have used a PostgreSQL database table as the datasource. You can use the pizza_sales.csv file to create and populate the database table.
